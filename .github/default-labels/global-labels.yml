# This is for now only list of standard Espressif issue/PR labels as a reference.
# Config files can be combined and projects grouped. For example, all org projects
#  will have set 'global-labels', then defined subset of projects 'global-labels' + 'component-labels', etc ...

# We plan to integrate it with GitHub action https://github.com/EndBug/label-sync
#  and sync labels to org projects from one place. This needs to be tested first.

# Properties explanation:
#  name - The name of the label.
#  color - The color of the label.
#  description - [optional] The description of the label.
#  aliases - [optional] An array containing the "aliases" of the label. If an existing label's name is an alias that label will be edited to match your config: this way you don't loose issues and PRs that have been labeled previously.
