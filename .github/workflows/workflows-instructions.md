These are [GitHub reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows) that can be called from any repository within the Espressif GitHub organization.

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> Their presence here does not mean they are automatically propagated or inherited across all Espressif organization GitHub repositories
> (as with issue and pull request templates).
> These workflows need to be explicitly called. See the ["Calling from the target repository"](#calling-from-the-target-repository) section for details.

## Reasoning

Managing these workflows from a central place like this repository (`espressif/.github`) offers several advantages:

- **Ease of Integration**: Simplifies the process for repository administratorsâ€”only a call statement is needed to integrate the workflow.
- **Centralized Updates**: Quickly update the version of a GitHub workflow for all repositories that use it with a single change here.
- **Consistent Permissions**: Ensure that action permissions are set correctly across all repositories.

## Calling from the target repository

In the target repository, e.g., `espressif/example-repo`, the following steps are required:

1. Create a file at the usual location for GitHub Actions workflow YAML files, such as `.github/workflows/call-pre-commit.yml`.
2. Add the call to the reusable workflow from another Espressif repository.
3. Optionally, you can add parameters that will be passed to the GitHub Action.

This allows precise customization of the local action configuration without needing to modify the full action YAML file.

> \[!NOTE\]
> If the configuration ever changes in the `espressif/.github` repository (this repo), there is no need to update every repository â€” the
> changes are propagated automatically.

For example, if an external action version is updated (e.g., `uses: actions/setup-python@v4` to `uses: actions/setup-python@v5`), the update would automatically apply to all repositories using this workflow.

## Troubleshooting

If the reusable workflow is not running in the target repository, check the following:

- **Actions and Workflow Permissions**: Ensure that the target repository allows `Allow all actions and reusable workflows` (in repo `Settings -> Actions -> Actions permissions`).
- **Correct Path to Reusable Workflow**: Double-check the path in the `uses:` directive. The correct format is `espressif/.github/.github/workflows/<WORKFLOW_FILE_NAME>.yml@main` (note the two `.github` segments in the path; the first refers to the .github repository, and the second refers to the .github directory within that repository).
